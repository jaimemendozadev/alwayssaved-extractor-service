# üß† [AlwaysSaved Extractor Service](https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/alwayssaved-extractor-service)

Welcome to the **AlwaysSaved** Extractor Service ‚Äî the user-facing web app that powers your private, searchable knowledge base for long-form media. Built to deliver fast, intelligent, and intuitive experiences, this interface lets users upload, explore, and query their personal content with ease.

This is the repository for the Extractor Service - Step 3 of the [App Flow](#alwayssaved-system-design--app-flow) and the real start of the AlwaysSaved ML/AI Pipeline.


For more information about What is AlwaysSaved and its Key Features, refer to the [AlwaysSaved Frontend README](https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/alwayssaved-fe-app).

## 3rd Party Services Needed

As a friendly reminder from the [AlwaysSaved Frontend](#https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/alwayssaved-fe-app), the following AWS Resources should have already been setup for this `Extractor Service` to work properly:

  - An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">s3 Bucket</a> with the right permissions for storing media files.
  - Parameters stored in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/" target="_blank">AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store</a>.

<br />

 An Amazon <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">Simple Queue Service</a> `Extractor Queue` was already created when you spun up the Frontend. You will now need to:

 - Create a second SQS queue we call the `Embedding Queue` that the `Extractor Service` uses to send payloads to the `Embedding Service` to continue the next part of the ML/AI Pipeline (see [Steps 4-5 of System Design Diagram](#alwayssaved-system-design--app-flow)).

## Starting the App

We need to use a virtual environment (we use the [Pipenv virtualenv management tool](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)) to run the app.

Navigate to the root of the project folder in your computer. Open 2 separate terminal windows that both point to the root of the project. In one of those terminal windows run the following commands:


Create and enter the virtual environment:
```
$ pipenv --python 3.11

```


Enter the virtual environment:

```
$ pipenv shell
```

Install the dependencies in the `Pipfile`:

```
$ pipenv install
```


Start the Extractor Service at the root `service.py` file:

```
$ python3 service.py
```

So basically the AlwaysSaved ML/AI Pipeline starts here in the `Extractor Service` in concert with the `Extractor Queue` (see [Steps 2-3 of System Design Diagram](#alwayssaved-system-design--app-flow)).


But first, a little explanation on the [Data Entities of AlwaysSaved](https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/alwayssaved-fe-app/tree/main/utils/mongodb/schemamodels) and how incoming requests to the `Extractor Service` arrive from the Frontend.

On the Frontend for v1, Users can upload a single or multiple `.mp4` Video `File`(s) to s3. When a single or multiple `Files` are uploaded to s3, the Frontend creates `File` MongoDB documents for each `File` upload.

Those newly created media `File` upload(s) are organized in a newly created MongoDB `"Note"` document.

When the `File` upload(s) to s3 finish, the Frontend sends an SQS Message Payload to the `Extractor Queue` that gets processed by the `Extractor Service`. The incoming SQS Message to the `Extractor Service` has the following shape:

```
[
  {
    user_id: string;
    media_uploads: [
      {
       note_id: ObjectID;
       user_id: ObjectID;
       s3_key: string;
      }
    ]
  }
]

```
<br />

Then for each SQS Message, for each `media_upload` in the Message Payload, the `Extractor Service` will:
  - Download the `.mp4` media `File` from s3;
  - Extract the `.mp3` audio file from the video;
  - Use the [Whisper Model](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) to transcribe the audio and create a `.txt` file of the transcript;
  - Upload the `.txt` transcript to s3; and
  - Send an outgoing SQS Message to the `Embedding Queue` [Step 4 of System Design Diagram](#alwayssaved-system-design--app-flow) with the following shape:


```
  {
      note_id: string;
      file_id: string;
      user_id: string;
      transcript_s3_key: string;
  }
```

The next part of the ML/AI Pipeline then moves on to the `Embedding Queue` and `Embedding Service` (see [Steps 4-5 of System Design Diagram](#alwayssaved-system-design--app-flow)).

## Environment and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Variables

You'll need to create a `.env` file at the root of this repo. There's only one variable that you have to prefill, which is the Region where all your AWS s3 Bucket and SQS Queues are located.

```
AWS_REGION=

```


For both development and production, there are a lot of variables that we couldn't store in the .env file, so we had to resort to using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/" target="_blank">AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store</a> ahead of time in order to get the app functioning.


The following variable keys have their values stored in the Parameter store as follows:

```
/alwayssaved/AWS_BUCKET

/alwayssaved/AWS_BUCKET_BASE_URL


/alwayssaved/EXTRACTOR_PUSH_QUEUE_URL

/alwayssaved/EMBEDDING_PUSH_QUEUE_URL


/alwayssaved/MONGO_DB_USER

/alwayssaved/MONGO_DB_PASSWORD

/alwayssaved/MONGO_DB_BASE_URI

/alwayssaved/MONGO_DB_NAME

/alwayssaved/MONGO_DB_CLUSTER_NAME

```


If you already setup your MongoDB Cluster and s3 Bucket by setting up the [AlwaysSaved Frontend](#https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/alwayssaved-fe-app), adding those values in the AWS Parameter Store should be easy.


Make sure that the `Extractor Service` SQS URL gets saved in the paramter store under `/alwayssaved/EXTRACTOR_PUSH_QUEUE_URL` and the newly created `Embedding Queue` URL gets saved under `/alwayssaved/EMBEDDING_PUSH_QUEUE_URL`.


For clarification, your `AWS_BUCKET_BASE_URL` really means the URL that points to your Bucket in AWS like so:

```
https://<AWS_BUCKET_NAME>.s3.amazonaws.com

```
